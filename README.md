## Abstract

Two paradigms characterize much of the research
in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral
science and design science. The behavioral-
science paradigm seeks to develop and verify
theories that explain or predict human or organi-
zational behavior. The design-science paradigm
seeks to extend the boundaries of human and
organizational capabilities by creating new and
innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are founda-
tional to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the
confluence of people, organizations, and techno-
logy. Our objective is to describe the performance
of design-science research in Information Sys-
tems via a concise conceptual framework and
clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and
evaluating the research. In the design-science
paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a
problem domain and its solution are achieved in
the building and application of the designed arti-
fact. Three recent exemplars in the research
literature are used to demonstrate the application
of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis
of the challenges of performing high-quality
design-science research in the context of the
broader IS community.
